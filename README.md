# dream11-team-select

A fun project when I am playing in Dream11, created this project which will scrape data from espncricinfo.com and from dream11, then create a UI to view players sorted by their score or points etc... using beautifulsoup and selenium

I barely remember as it's been 2 years, if anyone find it useful, can use....
